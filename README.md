# Native Platform Code

This is a hands on learning session I took in order to learn how to use Platform Specific code (Kotlin + Swift) in Flutter applications.


## What I learnt

How to implement funcionalities based on channels that resolve to methods in native languages depending on the platform, i.e. Android + Kotlin, Ios + Swift
